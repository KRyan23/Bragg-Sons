### Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section

### Business Stories

  1. Due to a recent survey we need to address the issue of communication and information gathering within for the business, we want to start with something relatively basic that meets our current needs and in the future if it works for us we would like to build on it to take payments from customers.

  2.  The staff at Bragg&Sons pride themselves in the work they do, but we would like to show some of that off to the greater public.

  3.  There’s rarely a bad word to be said about the service we provide and again we would like to get that message out there.

  4.  Social Media is a great communicator but the various pages we have on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram just feel too fragmented we need a website to tie them together.

- #### Addressing the Business needs

  1. In this scenario it was easy to identify that a comprehensive contact page was important to the success of the Bragg&Sons website.
  2. The business already uses social media to showcase some of its work but they felt a dedicated gallery page is needed to reinforce this.
  3. Bragg&Sons has a very good reputation locally and again we needed to reinforce this with a feedback section.
  4. This was addressed by having social media links consistently visible throughout the project.


### Users Stories
-   #### First Time Visitor Goals

    1. As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site.


        1. Upon entering the site, users are automatically greeted with a clean and easily readable navigation bar to go to the page of their choice. Underneath there is a Hero Image with text above it "Munster’s Most Trusted Painters".
        2. The main points are immediately met with the brief description of what the business is reinforced with the picture of a newly decorated room.
        3. The user has three options, scroll down and click the Gallery or the Testimonial page, or scroll down further and click the call to action button "Get Your Free Quote Today", the link for the Gallery brings them to the gallery page, the link for the Testimonial’s bring them to the testimonial page and the "Get Your Free Quote Today" brings them to the quote page.

    2. As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily be able to navigate throughout the site to find contact information.

        1. The site has been designed to be fluid and never to entrap the user. At the top of each page there is a clean navigation bar, each link describes what the page is and where the user will end up.
        2. At the bottom of the index, services, about and gallery pages there is a call to action "Top of page" to ensure the user always has somewhere to go and doesn't feel trapped as they get to the bottom of the page.
        3. On the Contact and Quote pages, after a form response is submitted, the formdump.codeinstitute.net service displays the values inputted from the user, if this were a production site the user would be redirected to a landing page with all the familiar navigation and message to say the response was received.

    3. As a First Time Visitor, I want to look for testimonials to understand what people think of their service.

        1. Once the new visitor lands on the page they are presented with intuitive navigation on the top right of the page.
        2. The user then has 2 ways to reach testimonials, they can select it directly from the navigation or if they scroll down to the Thumbnails picture of testimonials and click the link here.
        3. The user can then review the testimonials here or scroll down to the social media links at the bottom of the page to investigate further.

-   #### Returning Visitor Goals

    1. As a Returning Visitor, I would like an easy way to get in touch since I have some very specific questions.

        1. The "Contact" page is clearly shown in the navigation menu where the user will be able to choose which method suits them to get in touch.
        2. The user can choose from 4 different contact methods here.
        Firstly, there is a phone number which when clicked will ask you to make a phone call from your device.
        Secondly there is a link to send Bragg&Sons an email, which when clicked launches your default email application on your device.
        Thirdly the Businesses address is listed and when clicked opens up a new tab and the location pinned in google maps.
        Lastly the user can simply fill out the contact form and submit it.
        3. Finally the Business phone number, address and social media links are consistently show on the footer of each page.


    2. As a Returning Visitor, I want find out about the services they provide.

        1. Under the navigation menus the user will see a link to the services page.
        2. From here there is a list of the services provided and 'What to expect from our ... Service' section underneath.

    3. As a Returning Visitor, I would like to provide feedback via their social media pages.
        1. The Twitter icon can be found on the footer of every page and will open a new tab for the user to allow them to send a tweet.
        2. The Facebook icon can also be found on the footer of every page and will open a new tab for the user.
        (The reason I put the social media links at the bottom of the page is to expose the user to site  content in order for them to make a better decision prior to utilising social media)

-   #### Frequent User Goals

    1. As a Frequent User, I would like to check their site and social media for offers and updates.

        1. Any special offer available at the time the user lands on the home page will be obvious due to a site update.
        2. The user can choose follow or sign up to the BraggandSons social media pages for all other offers and updates to stay in touch.

    2. As a Frequent User, I would like an easy way to get a quote for my various properties.
        1. The user should be comfortable with the sites layout and can simply click any of the call to action buttons labelled "Get Your Free Quote Today".
        2. The user can submit the quotation form as many times as many times as they like using and number of specific criteria.


### Further Testing

-   The Website was tested on Google Chrome, Opera, Internet Explorer 11, Microsoft Edge and Firefox browsers.
- The website was continually checked on a variety of emulated devices under Chromes Developer tools, these included Desktop, Moto4, GalaxyS5, Pixel, IPhones5,6,7,8,X, IPad/Pro and the Surface Duo.
-   Internal and external linking were continually tested throughout the project to ensure functionality.
-   Family members were asked to review the site and to give their initial thoughts and feedback. The inputs were then fed back into 2 of user stories and the colour scheme choice was slightly altered after a review.
- Both the contact and quote forms were tested to ensure they behaved as normal, that is the required fields worked so that the users can submit a blank form. The code institute "https://formdump.codeinstitute.net/" was used to validate both forms. On the quote form the idea here would be to return a price to the customer via a script.

### Known Bugs

-   On Internet Explorer 11 the formatting on the quote page does not display correctly.

## Credits

### Code

-   [Bootstrap4](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/getting-started/introduction/): bootstrap was only partially used here on purpose, the idea was to get a better understanding on how Html and Css worked together, but I would choose to utilize it fully in future projects due to a lot of project time wasted on spent on alignment issues.
